Missing pieces:

- implement index creation
  * HARD (still missing knowledge about all the magic bits in index meta data)
- implement table, column, index renaming
  * EASY
- implement table, column, index deletion
  * EASY - MEDIUM
- implement more comprehensive unicode compression write support
  * EASY? (have the code, do we trust it?)
- implement duplicateTable(Table, db, newName), or (oldName, newName)
  - by doing binary level copy, could maybe workaround missing jackcess
    features (like create index)
  - do optional data copy which preserves autonumbers
  * EASY - MEDIUM
- implement createReadOnlyTemp(InputStream) (delete temp file on close)
  * EASY
