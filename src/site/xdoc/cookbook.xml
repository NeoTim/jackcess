      <p>
        This cookbook will attempt to familiarize the reader with the various
        nooks and crannies of the Jackcess API.  The API is large due to the
        large feature-set that an Access Database provides, so this cookbook
        will by no means be exhaustive.  However, this will hopefully give the
        reader enough useful building blocks such that the rest of the API can
        be discovered and utilized as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cookbook is a cross between a tutorial and a reference, so the
        reader should be able to skip to relevant sections without needing to
        read the entire preceding text.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this cookbook strives to present best practices for both the
        Jackcess API and Java programming in general, at times, the code may
        be trimmed for the sake of brevity.  For the same reason, pseudo-code
        may be used in places where the actual code is not relevant to the
        example.

    <section name="The Basics">
      <subsection name="Opening a Database">
        <p>
          So you have an Access Database and you want to do something with it.
          You want to use Java, and you may not even be running on Windows (or
          you tried the JDBC/ODBC bridge and it failed miserably).  Through
          some Google-fu, you landed here at the Jackcess project.  Now what?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the first thing you need to do is open the database.  The
          entry point class in the Jackcess API is, suprisingly enough, the
          <a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/Database.html">Database</a> class.
        </p>
        <source>
  Database db = Database.open(new File("mydb.mdb"));
</source>
        <p>
          That's it, now you have a Database instance (maybe this isn't that
          difficult after all).
        </p>
        <p>
          Important note, <i>always</i> make sure you close a Database
          instance when you are finished with it (preferably in a finally
          block like any other important resource).  Failure to close the
          Database instance could result in data loss or database corruption.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Reading a Table">
        <p>
          Okay, so you have a Database instance, now what?  Since pretty much
          everything in an Access database lives in a table, grabbing a <a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/Table.html">Table</a>
          would be the logical next step.
        </p>
        <source>
  Table table = db.getTable("Test");
</source>
        <p>
          Where's the data?  While a <a
          href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/Cursor.html">Cursor</a>
          is the best way to interact with the data in a Table, for the sake
          of simplicity when just getting started, we will use the simplified
          iteration provided by the Table class itself.  When reading row
          data, it is generally provided as a <code>Map&lt;String,Object&gt;</code> where the keys are the column
          names and the values are the strongly typed column values.
        </p>
        <source>
  for(Map&lt;String,Object&gt; row : table) {
    System.out.prinln("Look ma, a row: " + row);
  }
</source>
        <p>
          So, what's in a row?  Well, let's assume your "Test" table is
          defined in the following way in Access:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Field Name</th><th>Data Type</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ID</td><td>AutoNumber (Long Integer)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Name</td><td>Text</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Salary</td><td>Currency</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>StartDate</td><td>Date/Time</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Then, given a row of data, we could inspect the various <a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/Column.html">Columns</a> and
          their values like so:
        </p>
<source>
  Map&lt;String,Object&gt; row = ...;
  for(Column column : table.getColumns()) {
    String columnName = column.getName();
    Object value = row.get(columnName);
    System.out.println("Column " + columnName + "(" + column.getType() + "): "
                       + value + " (" + value.getClass() + ")");
  }

  // Example Output:
  //
  // Column ID(LONG): 27 (java.lang.Integer)
  // Column Name(TEXT): Bob Smith (java.lang.String)
  // Column Name(MONEY): 50000.00 (java.math.BigDecimal)
  // Column StartDate(SHORT_DATE_TIME): Mon Jan 05 09:00:00 EDT 2010 (java.util.Date)
</source>
        <p>
          As you can see in this example (and as previously mentioned), the
          row values are <i>strongly typed</i> Java objects.  In Jackcess, the
          column types are represented by a Java enum named <a href="apidocs/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/DataType.html">DataType</a>.
          The DataType javadoc details the Java types used to return row
          values as well as the value types which are acceptable inputs for
          new rows (more on this later).  One other thing to note in this
          example is that the column names in the row Map are <i>case
          sensitive</i> strings.
